# Contracts

**Note**: This feature is a frontend-only refactor with no API or external service contracts. No contract definitions are required.

The refactor involves:

- Internal component restructuring
- Router configuration
- State management reorganization

All changes are contained within the React application and do not affect any external APIs or services.
